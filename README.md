Hello, My name is Luis Castro and this is my Beer Application.

The functionality is pretty simple:

-I use a fetch request to GET the Beers API
-I render all the Beers into an array
-I then iterate througth the array creating individual beers
-Each beer is then assigned a Div with a name, tagline and ABV% field for the corresponding key values
-I decided for additional functionality I would create a Description button for each beer
-Each button would then trigger a click event that when called upon displays the description for each unique beer in a modal
-after 10 seconds the modal is removed from the screen until called upon again
